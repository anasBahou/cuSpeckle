# Examples

Three main examples are provided to demonstrate some use-cases of this software:
	* "example_id.txt": generating non-deformed speckle images with the identity mapping function
	* "example_star.txt": generating a deformed speckle image with the "star" displacement mapping function
	* "mesh_example/" : generating deformed speckle image with diplacement maps
